# Description
Cozic is a music player developed to fill my needs for my Cozy Cloud. It uses SoundManager2 javascript library. 

If you want to test it go to https://demo.cozycloud.cc/#apps/cozic/ .

shortcuts enabled :
- spacebar : play/pause
- "b" : previous track
- "n" : next track
- "-" : volume down
- "+" : volume up
- "m" : mute
- "v" : switch between tracks view and play-queue view

### NB
For now, it's impossible to upload file from IE.

### Warning
Don't try to upload songs from multiple devices simultaneously or you'll regret it.

# What is Cozy?

[Cozy](http://cozy.io) is a platform that brings all your web services in the
same private space.  With it, your web apps and your devices can share data
easily, providing you
with a new experience. You can install Cozy on your own hardware where no one
profiles you. You install only the applications you want. You can build your
own one too.
